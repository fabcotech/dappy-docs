# Generate and publish root certificates

At the top level, dappy allows you to have a self signed certificate. This is because **you are your own certificate authority** ðŸ”’ðŸ”’ðŸ”’, you don't have to ask permission to exist !

## The easy way

You can use directly `@fabcotech/dappy-cli`, it has bindings with `openssl`.

```bash
# Generate .key and .crt files for all hosts under 
# a domain (dappy.config.json file)
npx @fabcotech/dappy-cli generatecerts --domain mydomain.d

# Apply cert for all hosts under a domain
# in dappy.config.json
npx @fabcotech/dappy-cli apply --cert group1.crt --domain mydomain.d

# Generate .key and .crt files for a set of hosts
npx @fabcotech/dappy-cli generatecerts --hosts mydomain.d foo.mydomain.d

# Apply the cert for each host in dappy.config.json
npx @fabcotech/dappy-cli apply --cert group1.crt --hosts mydomain.d foo.mydomain.d
```

**ðŸ’¡ Note :** You can create a single certificate for all hosts under a domain by using the --domain argument instead of listing all hosts. Having less certificates will also simplify your configuration on the server side.

## The less easy way

Below is the `openssl` command we use yo generate a self signed certificate. Change `mydomain` so that it fits your domain of course. We also provide the equivalent command in dappy-cli.

```bash
# with openssl
openssl req \
  -x509 \
  -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -sha256 \
  -days 10000 \
  -nodes \
  -keyout mydomain.key \
  -out mydomain.crt \
  -outform PEM \
  -subj '/CN=paul.gamma'\
  -extensions san \
  -config <( \
    echo '[req]'; \
    echo 'distinguished_name=req'; \
    echo '[san]'; \
    echo 'subjectAltName=DNS.1:paul.gamma')
```

You are free to choose for how many days your certificate is valid.

Softwares resolving dappy zones need to get the certificate as base64, therefore you now have to turn it into a base64 and add it to your zone. **Be careful, your base64 should have no carriage return and be only one line**.

```bash
# turn to base64 and remove carriage returns
base64 mydomain.crt > tmp.crt && tr -d '\n' < tmp.crt > mydomain.base64
```

Now we must add the CERT record to our config file and push again.

```json title="dappy.config.json"
{
  config: { ... },
  zones: [{
    "origin": "mydomain",
    "ttl": 3600,
    "records": [
      ...
      {
        "name": "@",
        "type": "CERT",
        "data": "LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRV..."
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

## Checking and updating zones

```bash
npx @fabcotech/dappy-cli pushzones
npx @fabcotech/dappy-cli check
```

**ðŸ’¡ Note :** the certificate you have forged **is a true root certificate** not signed by any certificate authority (you are the CA), it will be retreived with co-resolution by dappy browser, just like the IP addresses.
