# Create a zone

Let's setup our first zone in `dappy.config.json`. A zone is simply the equivalent of a DNS (domain name system) zone, in the dappy name system. We will create a simple zone, the goal is to have a https website running on `localhost` (IP `127.0.0.1`).

```json title="dappy.config.json"
{
  "options": { ... },
  "zones": [
    {
      "origin": "mydomain",
      "ttl": 3600,
      "records": [
        {
          "name": "@",
          "type": "A",
          "data": "127.0.0.1"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

üîç Take the time to understand what is going on. Dappy CLI has created a new entry in the `config.zones` array. This new entry has three interesting properties:
- `origin: "mydomain"` : this must obviously be replaced by your domain (without the `.d` at the end) this is the TLD.
- `type "A" record with data: "127.0.0.1"` : this tells dappy browser or any program that can resolve dappy names that `"127.0.0.1"` is the IP address at which the web app corresponding to `"mydomain"` will be served.


```bash
npx @fabcotech/dappy-cli pushzones
```

You should have the following log.

```
Using dappy network gamma
‚®Ø mydomain           : local zone is invalid, no owner
```

**The owner TXT record**

That is great, it means we have forgotten the only record that is always needed for a zone to be valid : a TXT record with the owner (identified with the public key). Let's add it.

```json title="dappy.config.json"
{
  "options": { ... },
  "zones": [
    {
      "origin": "mydomain",
      "ttl": 3600,
      "records": [
        ...
        { "name": "@", "type": "TXT", "data": "OWNER=mypublickey" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

```bash
npx @fabcotech/dappy-cli pushzones
```

You should have the following log.

```
Using dappy network gamma
Will process the following zones        : bobby53
Dappy network   :  gamma
Public key      :  abcdefgh
Purchases and updates were deployed, now do dappy-cli check to verify the state of your domains
```

That's it, our zone is created, you can check as many time as you want now that your DNS zone is stored in the dappy name system, and ready to be resolved (co-resolved) by clients.

```bash
npx @fabcotech/dappy-cli check
```

**üîç What's hapenning under the hood ?**

When you do the `pushzones` command, dappy CLI takes your private key, signes the zone, sends this signed message to a member of the dappy network it knows. The network members will each verify the message, update the zone and gossip the message to others. After few seconds everyone has the new version and clients can keep doing co-resolution !
