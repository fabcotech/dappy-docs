# Update the zone

Anytime you need to update your zone, just change the A, or CERT records, and use the same `push` command. It will update one or thousands of zones that you have configured, only if necessary !

```bash
npx @fabcotech/dappy-cli push
```

**Hundreds of TLDs, subdomains, one JSON file**

🔍 By looking at the `dappy.config.json` file you should understand that you can manage hundreds of zone files, TLDs and subdomains with only this JSON file. This is how simple it gets 👌👌👌 !
