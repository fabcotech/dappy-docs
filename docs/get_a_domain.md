# Get a domain

## Purchase domain name (or get one for free)

If you work with the `d` network (mainnet) you'll need to go through credit card payment, if you work with the `gamma` network you can get a domain name for free here.

`d` network (production) : [https://app.dappy.tech](https://app.dappy.tech)

`gamma` network (test / development for free) : [https://gamma.dappy.tech](https://gamma.dappy.tech)

Once you have purchased a domain name, input your public key in the `Orders` tab and wait few minutes to get the status `Transfered to public key`.

```bash
npx @fabcotech/dappy-cli printpublickey
```
