# Upload the zone

The zone is configured but not yet uploaded on the blockchain, nor the NFT reserved. We should have everything we need.

```bash
npx dappy-cli pushzones
```

The logs should look something like this

```

If for some reason `helloworld` is already taken on the name system you are working with. Feel free to change it to anything else. The TLS certificate should work with any domain (wildcard).

You will need to generate a certificate as well, which is not the one provided by default by dappy CLI, check [certificate](certificate.md).

**Hundreds of TLDs, subdomains, one JSON file**

By looking at the `dappy.config.json` file you should understand that you can manage hundreds of zone files, TLDs and subdomains with only this JSON file. This is how simple it gets ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ !
